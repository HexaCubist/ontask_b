You can always click in the *Workflows* item at the top menu to go back to
the home page and select a different workflow to open (or create a new one).

From the home page you can also perform some additional operations in the worklow such as :ref:`rename and change the workflow description<details_rename>`, :ref:`cloning (create and exact replica of this workflow with another name)<details_clone>`, :ref:`delete all data in the workflow table<details_flush_data>`, or :ref:`delete the workflow<details_delete>`.

From any screen in the platform, the icon in the top right corner next to your profile image is a link to the OnTask documentation.
