Open a workflow
===============

When you open a workflow, a page with its details is shown like the one in
the following figure

.. figure:: ../../scaptures/workflow_details_empty.png
   :align: center

In this case the page only shows basic details because the workflow does not
have any data stored in its table. While the workflow is open, the top menu
contains the following links:

Details
  Is the current page that shows information about the columns, data types,
  number of actions, etc. contained in the workflow (empty now because we
  haven't populated it)

Table
  Operations to visualize and manipulate the table (search for values, add a
  row, add a column)

Actions
  Create, edit and execute actions.

Logs
  A table showing the history of operations performed on this workflow

In the current *Details* page, immediately under the title there are buttons
to perform the following operations:

- Manage table data

  - :ref:`Upload or merge data to the table <data_upload>`

  - :ref:`Run a plugin to transform the data in the table <plugin_run>`

- Workflow operations:

  - :ref:`Edit the attributes <details_attributes>`

  - :ref:`Export the workflow <details_export>`

  - :ref:`Rename or change the workflow description <details_rename>`

  - :ref:`Share the workflow with other users in the platform <details_sharing>`

  - :ref:`Clone the workflow <details_clone>`

  - :ref:`Flush the data in the table <details_flush_data>`

  - :ref:`Delete the workflow <details_delete>`
