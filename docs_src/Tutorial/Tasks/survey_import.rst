===========================

OnTask offers a `library of pre-defined surveys <https://github.com/abelardopardo/ontask_b/tree/master/surveys>`_ that can be uploaded to your workflow. Connect to the platform and go to the action page of an existing workflow (or alternatively create a workflow and upload some data). Download one of the pre-defined tests and store the file in your computer. Click in the *import action* button.
