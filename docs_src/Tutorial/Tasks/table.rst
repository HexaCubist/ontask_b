Column and Row Statistics
-------------------------

If you click in the button with the column name in any of the table view and
select the *Statistics*, OnTask shows a page with an statistical description
of the values in that column. The analogous option is available through the
*Operations* button in the row (left side of the table view). The page shows
identical representations than in the case of the column stats, but for each
column the words *Your value* appear in the location corresponding to the value
in the row.
