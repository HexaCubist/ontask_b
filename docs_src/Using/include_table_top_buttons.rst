The buttons at the top of the page offer the following functions:

|fa-plus| Row
  A form to introduce a new row in the table with one field per column.

|fa-plus| Column
  Add a new column to the table. The pull-down menu also allows to add a column with values calculated with a formula and using the existing values, or a column with random values (See :ref:`Adding a column <details_add_column>` for a detailed explanation).

:ref:`Manage table data <dataops>`
  Menu to upload/merge data to the table (see :ref:`dataops` for a detailed explanation), execute a plugin, or delete the data in the table.

|fa-eye| Views
  A view is a screen showing a subset of rows and/or columns in the table. Clicking in the Views link will take you to another screen to :ref:`manage these views <table_views>`. The pull down menu offers links to access the subset of the table defined by the available views.

|fa-dashboard| Dashboard
  The dashboard shows a statistical summary for the columns shown in the table. This number may be too high, so you should consider using :ref:`table_views` to reduce the amount of information shown in the dashboard.

|fa-download| CSV Download
  This functionality downloads the data in the table as a CSV file. Combine this functionality with the :ref:`table_views` to handle large tables.
